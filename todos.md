M.E.A.N. App todo list
=============================================

### Testing:

* Add test data to be imported before running tests.

#### Visuals:

* Redo the designs of the main posts page

#### Development Process: 

* Create deployment script for project

* Automatically re-deploy when master branch is pushed to - without using someone else's continuous integration service. (Deploy, run all end to end tests, if everything is broken then roll back automatically)
